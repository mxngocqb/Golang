Least square solution to calculate the user position given the navigation message, pseudorange
and accumulated delta range measurements. Also calculates user velocity non-iteratively from
Least square position solution.

<p>The method fills the user position and velocity in ECEF coordinates and receiver clock
offset in meters and clock offset rate in meters per second.

<p>One can choose between no smoothing, using the carrier phase measurements (accumulated delta
range) or the doppler measurements (pseudorange rate) for smoothing the pseudorange. The
smoothing is applied only if time has changed below a specific threshold since last invocation.
